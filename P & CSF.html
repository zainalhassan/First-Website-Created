	<h2> Unit 1 - Programming </h2>

		<img id="img2" src="Images\P.jpg" alt="Image of a code that creates a simple bike race game" >
		<p> Programming is arguably the most important unit in this course as it teaches students important languages such as Java. Languages such as Java may very well be used in life as a Software Engineer and therefore it is vital that us students get to grips with learning to code. </p>
		<p> Personally, I am enjoying this unit as it is very practical. I do find it hard at times especially with debugging as I have no prior experience with Programming. However, I believe that if I try hard and spend a lot of time on learning to code then I will soon get the hang of it. So far, in Programming, we have learnt how to properly scale your code as well as animating it. Each lab has given us a chance to showcase the knowledge learnt from the lecture and going into the lab knowing what will be taught today has helped me to settle in too.</p>
		<p> The image below shows a simple game that we made in the lab that consists of 3 bikes and the right edge of the screen is the finishing line. To restart the game you need to press the spacebar. This code has procedures to make the code easier to read. </p>
		<p> The software that has been used so far is Processing - a flexible software sketchbook. The program can be downloaded from the link: <a href ="https://www.processing.org/" > Processing  </a> </p>

	<h3> Unit 2 - Computer Systems Fundamentals </h3>
	
	<img id="img3" src="Images\CSF.jpg" alt="Image of bike race with the code alongside it" width="1000px" height="auto" >
	<p> The Computer Systems Fundamentals unit covers topics such as Digital Logic and Boolean Algebra. within these topics we have been taught how to build digital logic circuits using Logisim software. This piece of software allows us to build circuits as well as find the Boolean expressioin of that circuit, the truth table and the Karnaugh map.</p>
	<p> We have also learnt about the core component of the computer - the CPU (central processing unit). Maths has been quite a fundamental part of the unit and the maths we have so far learnt is under the category of discrete Maths. Maths topics such as Sets,Matrices and Vectors have been taught. </p>

		<p> I am a 19 year old who is currently studying BSc Software Engineering at Manchester Metropolitan University.</p>
		<p div id="dob"> I was born on the 9th November 1998.</p>
		<p> The main reason why I chose this course was because I had a genuine interest in the world of technology. Previously, I had studied ICT at both GCSE and A level and I enjoyed it very much. I felt that the next logical step would be to choose a computer related course as it would suit me. Software Engineering appealed to me more than Computing as it allows you to specialise in a field and gives you a taster on what life would be like as a Software Developer.</p>

	<h3> Work </h3>
	
	<p>I have previously worked as a part time counterstaff at Chunky Chicken. This job has given me an insight on what professional work will be like. Throughout my time here, I have learned valuable skills that have enhanced me in many ways. I have learnt how to speak to customers in a professional manner. As well as this, the job has taught me how to perform consistently under pressure as the slightest of mistakes could lead to an order being incorrectly packed.     </p>

		<p> Education has been very important to me as I believe that, with dedication, hard work and self belief, a person is able to bring out the best out of themself. I studied at Derby High School for 5 years to achieve my GCSEs. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at high school and my efforts paid off with grades that I am pleased with. </p>
		<p> College was a much different experience to high school as the student had much more of a responsibility for themself. This was emphasised with the free periods that the student would decide how to use them. I felt that I needed an adaptation phase from high school to college so I could settle in. Personally, I found college to be very difficult for me and the subjects I chose proved to be particularly challenging. </p>

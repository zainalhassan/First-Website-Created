	<h2> Graduate Attributes (Soft Skills) </h2>
	
		<p> During my short time at university, I have already seen improvements to my soft skills as the course puts an emphasis on improving yourself. Critical thinking and problem solving has been thoroughly tested these past few weeks for example in Programming, if your code does not work then you need to be able to locate the error and solve the problem. Coming from no coding background, I found this to be tricky but with practice I have got better at finding errors within a piece of code.</p>
		<p> Professionalism is a soft skill that I have acquired from my time working as a counter-staff. Working for a professional business means that you represent the business when at work, therefore you will have to behave in a manner in which the business approves of. This lead to a vast improvement in my communication skills as the job was heavily focussed on speaking to customers and producing orders for them. I have learnt how to talk professionally to a customer and how to deal with their requests. </p>
		<p> Completing the NCS Programme in the summmer 2016 allowed me to improve my teamwork and leadership skills. The main project was to create a campaign to raise awareness for a local charity. This project required a project team leader which would delegate roles to people in the group as well as help out anyone that needs assistance A lot of pressure was placed on my shoulders to be the team leader as I had to ensure that everyone was getting their opinions and voices heard as well as everyonebeing happy with the final campaign. It was my responsibility to make sure that the campaign went as smoothly as possible. </p>
		<p> The campaign day went extremeley well as we ended up raising £150 instead of the expected £50.</p>
		<p> Graduating from a University Access Programme has helped me gain experience of what university lifestyle will be like. I attended many workshops, lectures, made notes, tackled independent study and also problem based learning. My teamwork skills were tested and improved in workshops as well as independent study skills were displayed in my successful academic assignment. The assignment was heavily focussed on independent research, at university level. Harvard referencing was a requirement as well as the use of many different types of references. The final grade i achieved was 60/64. I was pleased with this mark as my hard work had paid off.</p>

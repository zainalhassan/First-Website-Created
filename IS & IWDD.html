	<h2> Unit 3 - Information Systems </h2>
	
		<img id="img5" src="Images\IS.jpg" alt="Use Case Story of a scenario-Big John's">
		<p> Information Systems Term 1 looks at how Organisations use Information Systems and what use they provide them with. Systems Analysis and Design is covered too, for example the picture on the right shows a Use Case from a given scenario. Identifying the Users (Actors) and what they can do is vital to creating a successful Use Case. As well as this, there has been a heavy focus on group work with part 1 of a group assignment completed and 2 group presentations given to the class. </p>
		<p> As I have previously studied Information communication Technology at both High School and College, I feel more familiar with this unit, and therfore, the content that we have been learning has been straightforward for me. I am enjoying this unit and also enjoy the assignments that have been given to us. As this unit is more focussed on group projects, it provides a breath of fresh air. </p>

	<h3> Unit 4 - Introduction to Web Design & Development </h3>
	
		<img id="img6" src="Images\Iwdd.jpg" alt="Coding behind the e-portfolio">
		<p> in Term 1 of Introdution to Web Design & Development, we have learnt the basics of HTML and CSS and how to properly use them to produce an e-portfolio. Client-side technologies have been used to strucure and present interactive web pages. This unit has been very practical as the assignment was given to us straight away. I am enjoying this unit as I can see the improvements that I am making. As much as I enjoy the unit, the assignment proved to be a challenge as it was something new for me. I needed to learn quickly how to use HTML and CSS and for that, there was no room for errors. There wasn't much help I could get with my assignment so fixing errors was extremely hard but I felt that I got better as time went on. </p>
		<p> The software used to create the e-portfolio was Notepad++ - a source code editor supporting many languages. The reason why I used this piece of software instread of Notepad was because this software changes your html tags a differen colour so your code is much easier to read.</p>
